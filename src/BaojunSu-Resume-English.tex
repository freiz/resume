\section{Projects}

  \subsection{Distributed Key-Value Datastore}
  \cvitem{Introduction}{Online serving datastore, serving TB data with low latency and can scale out horizontally, with the ability to plugin user logic as SPROC.}
  \cvitem{Timeline}{2013.10 -- 2014.9}
  \cvitem{Duty}{System design, part of implementation, performance tuning.}
  \cvitem{Results}{Compared to the old system hosted on SQL Server, the .95 has been reduced to 1/10 with the same request, and at the same time increased the flexibility and the readability of SPROC.}

  \subsection{Timeliness Web Crawler}
  \cvitem{Introduction}{Crawl news from portal sites, forums, microblogs with low latency.}
  \cvitem{Timeline}{2011.10 -- 2012.4}
  \cvitem{Duty}{Project leader with three team members, architecture design and implementation.}
  \cvitem{Results}{The timeliness coverage rate has been catching up with Baidu after this system going online, compared to nearly no timely results before.}

  \subsection{Efficiency Optimization of DNS Resolve}
  \cvitem{Introduction}{The DNS lookup latency has been becoming the bottleneck of main crawler's efficiency and we try to speedup it.}
  \cvitem{Timeline}{2011.4 -- 2011.6}
  \cvitem{Duty}{Performance optimization.}
  \cvitem{Results}{The DNS lookup latency has been sped up by above 10 times.}

  \subsection{Terminator}
  \cvitem{Introduction}{A two-layer ensemble spam filter, open sourced at github.}
  \cvitem{url}{\url{https://github.com/freiz/terminator}}
  \cvitem{Timeline}{2009 -- 2010}
  \cvitem{Results}{Implemented my ensemble algorithm and ensemble 8 advanced classifiers, can achieve the best results on \emph{All} public datasets.}

\section{Experience}

  \subsection{Open Source}
  \cvitem{2010}{NSNB spam filter won the first place in large-scale spam filtering competition of Eights Symposium of Search Engine and Web Mining, which is implemented in Python and open sourced at \url{http://code.google.com/p/nsnb}.}
