\section{Projects}

  \subsection{Distributed Key-Value Datastore}
  \cvitem{Introduction}{Online serving data in TB and at the same time with low latency, with the ability to plugin user logic as SPROC.}
  \cvitem{Timeline}{2013.10 -- 2014.9}
  \cvitem{Duty}{System design, part of implementation, performance tuning.}
  \cvitem{Results}{Compared to the old system hosted on SQL Server, the .95 has been reduced to 1/3 to 1/10 with the same request, and at the same time increased the flexibility and the readability of SPROC.}

  \subsection{Product Recommendation Service}
